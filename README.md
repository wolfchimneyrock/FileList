# FileList
## Clone of unix commands ls and find in java 
This was a project for my class 'Application design and implementation' CISC3120.  The intent was to design an extensible modular framework that is able to be used for various file system related tasks.  

Key features:
## FileList:
1.  Plain and Extended output
2.  Colored output based on filetype
3.  Sort by name, size, date
4.  Recursive listing of subdirectories

## Find:
1.  globbing, regex pattern matching
2.  pruning based on pattern
3.  features inherited from FileList above
